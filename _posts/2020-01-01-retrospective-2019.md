I have to major drivers pushing me to work on Odysseus. The first being how much I love and appreciate [software freedom](https://elementary.io/open-source/), [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/), & the sheer range of things published to The Web! These aspects of Odysseus were easy to implement.

My other driver is my curiosity to explore new ways to (re)discover useful/entertaining/interesting webpages, in a way that's both more effective and privacy-protecting. And in 2019 it [no longer](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/28/tech-industry-year-in-review-facebook-google-amazon) appears to be just me [asking](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/22/sacha-baron-cohen-facebook-propaganda) these questions.

Towards this end, in 2018 I've implemented:
* Easily skimmable browser history
* History search
* Topsites
* Personal recommendations
* Webfeed previews

And in 2019 I've implemented:
* App recommendations (from the elementary AppCenter, or whatever package repositories you use) for handling unsupported links
* Webfeed autodiscovery
* Personalized recommendations

So in 2020 I think I'll probably finish my vision for Odysseus by adding:
* Tagged bookmarks
* Bookmarks sharing
* Combined websearch
* Randomized homepages

I've already mostly built a custom control for these that should help me continue to keeping my browser UI very minimal! I'm excited!

In other news, this site is now self-hosted, Odysseus is being packaged for other distros (having received requests for that), I now have a [personal website](https://adrian.geek.nz/), and I'm starting my second web browser! That other browser, "Rhapsode", explores how well The Web to new I/O mediums like voice assistants, and the output side is already working very well.

My 2020 is shaping up to be a great year, and I hope it does for you too!
